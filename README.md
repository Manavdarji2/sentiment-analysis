```MARKDOWN
# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository contains a **Sentiment Analysis** project implemented in Python using various NLP and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify textual data into sentiments such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that helps in understanding customer emotions, opinions, and feedback. In this notebook:

- We explore a labeled dataset containing text and sentiment labels.
- We perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- We use TF-IDF vectorization.
- We train several machine learning models to classify sentiments.
- We evaluate model performance using various metrics.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manavdarji2/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
````

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # for Unix
   .\env\Scripts\activate   # for Windows
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📝 Results

* The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (replace with actual value).
* Text preprocessing significantly improved classification accuracy.
* TF-IDF vectorization yielded better results than Bag-of-Words.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better performance.
* Expand dataset to include more real-world data.
* Deploy the model via a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
